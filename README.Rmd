# functionsnashid

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of functionsnashid is to implement counting the number of observations per category. 

## Installation

You can install the released version of functionsnashid from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("functionsnashid")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("stat545ubc-2021/functionsnashid")
```
## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem.

In the following example, we get the number of games per genre from the steam_games dataset.

```{r example}
library(functionsnashid)
library(tidyverse)
library(datateachr)

games <- steam_games %>%
  select(id, name, genre, publisher, developer, original_price, release_date, all_reviews) %>%
  separate_rows(genre, sep = ",", convert = TRUE)

count_by_category(games, genre, 5)

```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/master/examples>.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
